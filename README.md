# Digital-Clock

### Description:

The project is based on a digital clock. This helps us when we know the present time but canâ€™t keep a record of the future time. It is similar to a watch. Once you set the present time, it works the same way as a watch does. It also has feature called the *'Day Change Indicator'*. This is an infinite loop program. One can close the terminal window for termination of the execution.
